# Terminology API

Terminology.io is an online, crowd-sourced thesaurus targeting technical professions, especially software engineers. Technical professionals have a jargon all their own that is unaddressed by most general purpose thesauruses. The goal of Terminology.io is simple, to make finding and naming things easier by connecting terms based on a specific technical context rather than typical semantic context. A simple example is the use of "factory" which has a different meaning to software engineers than it does to lay persons. Within software engineering, potential synonyms for "factory" could include "provider", "builder", "maker", etc. which are not likely to be found in a traditional thesaurus.

## Status

This project is under active development, as time allows. The first iteration of the API is mostly complete. The next major project is adding a nice frontend for the web.
